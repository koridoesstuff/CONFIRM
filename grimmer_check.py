"""GRIMMER test over extracted_data.csv - the SD counterpart to GRIM.

GRIM constrains the mean of integer data: the total is an integer, so the mean
must be total/n. GRIMMER extends the same argument to the standard deviation.
If every value is an integer then the sum of squares is an integer too, which
pins the SD down to a discrete set of reachable values.

Three conditions must hold together:

  1. The mean is GRIM-consistent - at least one integer total rounds to it.
  2. Some integer sum of squares falls inside the interval implied by the
     reported SD's rounding bounds.
  3. That sum of squares has the same parity as the total. For any integer x,
     x squared and x share a parity, so summing over the sample gives
     sum-of-squares congruent to total, modulo 2.

The candidate is then reconstructed and rounded back, to confirm it reproduces
the reported SD rather than merely sitting near it.

Applicability is decided by the same classifier as grim_check.py, so a row
excluded there is excluded here for the same stated reason. Two exclusions are
specific to this test:

  * no SD reported                  -> "not applicable - no standard deviation"
  * the mean already fails GRIM     -> "not applicable - mean fails GRIM"
    (grim_check.py reports that row; repeating it here would double-count)

GRIMMER is a weaker net than GRIM. An SD one unit away from the true value is
often still reachable, so a pass is weaker evidence than a GRIM pass. A failure
means the same thing a GRIM failure does: the reported value cannot have come
from integer data at the stated sample size, whatever the cause.

Usage:
    python grimmer_check.py
    python grimmer_check.py --data extracted_data.csv --out grimmer_results.csv
